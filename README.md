# CountryGame

## Overview
An app that displays a country's flag and other facts obtained from an api where two users compete to type the name faster than the other.

## Using CountryGame
Two users can connect to the app and enter their names.  Once two players are connected the game will start and a random flag and country information will be displayed.  Players can type in the chat to taunt the other player or to guess the name of the country.  When the correct country name has been entered by a player, the game will end.

## Technologies
Firebase, HTML, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery

## Notes
This was part of a group project for the Coding Bootcamp at UCLA Extension.  I wrote most of the logic for displaying the country information and checking user chat messages for the correct answer.
